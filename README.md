"What did you do particularly well?"

"Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?"

"Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?"

"What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?"

"How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?"
